# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

This is my first project, which was built using HTML and CSS. This project was built to help me understand how simple webpages are linked together, how CSS
is applied to style the tags, divs and pages. After the project was finished, Github was used to show me how files are backed up and stored in a repository, which is
a critical part of building and storing web sites.

HTML was used to build the pages and link them together. A link to the external CSS page was added in the head section of the HTML so that each page could have styles applied.
Having a single page of CSS makes life easier as styles can be applied to multiple items on multiple pages, without the need to apply them to each item on every page and remember
to change each one.

In the nav bar at the top of each page a link to each page was created so they will be linked together and basic CSS was applied to it, to style it.
A Wikipedia link to a page explaining each type of technology was pasted into the a href.
A link to an image letting people see what the techology is was pasted into the img tag. This was completed for each technology that will be used.
